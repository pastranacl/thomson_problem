# Thomsom's problem minimizer



## Description
Monte Carlo minimisation routine with simulated annealing.

## Execution
To execute the program call the script `exec_mcsphere.sh N M` where `N` is the number of particles on the spherical shell and `M` is the number of Monte Carlo minimisation steps. The number of steps depends on the number of particles. For instance, a good starting point is `exec_mcsphere.sh 500 300000`.
